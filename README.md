# NightfireLoadTimer
A script that checks when 007: Nightfire (GameCube) is showing a loading screen

## How to Use:

1) Download the latest version of [Dolphin 5.0 Lua Core](https://github.com/SwareJonge/Dolphin-Lua-Core)
2) Download this script and place it in the "Scripts" folder (Sys > Scripts)
3) Start running the North American version of 007: Nightfire in the emulator
4) While the game is running, go to Tools > Execute Script
5) Find "NightfireLoads.lua" in the drop-down list and click "Start"

If you get an error message saying something about not being able to read an address, go to config > Interface and disable "Use Panic Handlers."
